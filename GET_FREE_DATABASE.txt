  MISSING PIECE: THE DATABASE
========================================

You are absolutely right. Netlify does not give you a database.
Without a database, you cannot:
- Log in
- Register customers
- Save bookings
- Save reviews

========================================
  SOLUTION: GET A FREE DATABASE (2 MINS)
========================================

I recommend using **Neon** (it is free and very fast).

STEP 1: Go to https://neon.tech
STEP 2: Sign up (Free)
STEP 3: Create a project (Name: ThreeSpaceShine)
STEP 4: Copy the "Connection String" (It looks like: postgres://...)

========================================
  CONNECT IT TO YOUR BACKEND
========================================

IF YOU ARE USING RAILWAY (Recommended for Backend):
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Variables -> Add Variable
3. Key: DATABASE_URL
4. Value: (Paste the neon connection string)

IF YOU ARE USING RENDER:
1. Go to your Render Web Service
2. Environment -> Add Environment Variable
3. Key: DATABASE_URL
4. Value: (Paste the neon connection string)

========================================
  THEN UPDATE NETLIFY
========================================

1. Go to Netlify Site Settings
2. Environment Variables
3. Add:
   REACT_APP_API_URL = (Your Railway/Render Backend URL)

Now your frontend (Netlify) talks to your backend (Railway/Render), which talks to your database (Neon).
