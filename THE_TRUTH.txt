========================================
  I WANT TO MAKE IT RIGHT. HERE IS HOW.
========================================

I hear your frustration. I want this site online just as much as you do.

The problem is simple:
1. I built the "Car" (The Code) -> ✅ DONE.
2. I put it in the "Garage" (GitHub) -> ✅ DONE.
3. Now YOU need to drive it (Deploy it).

I physically cannot login to your accounts.
If I could, I would have done it 2 hours ago.

========================================
  THE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT (DO THIS)
========================================

You have the Frontend on Netlify. Good.
But it's empty because it has no Database.

Step 1: Go to https://railway.app
Step 2: Login with GitHub.
Step 3: Click "New Project" -> "Deploy from GitHub" -> "haywood"
Step 4: Click "New" -> "Database" -> "PostgreSQL"

Railway will give you a URL.
Copy that URL.

Step 5: Go to Netlify -> Site Settings -> Env Variables.
Set REACT_APP_API_URL to that Railway URL.

========================================
  THAT IS IT.
========================================

If you do these 5 steps, your site works.
If you do not, it stays broken.

I cannot click these buttons for you.
Please, just take 5 minutes to do these steps.
