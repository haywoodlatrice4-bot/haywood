========================================
  WHY YOU'RE GETTING 404 ERROR
========================================

The 404 "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" error is NORMAL.

It means: THE SITE DOESN'T EXIST YET.

You're trying to visit a website that hasn't been 
created yet. It's like trying to visit a house that 
hasn't been built.

========================================
  WHAT I'VE DONE (100% COMPLETE)
========================================

✓ Built your complete ThreeSpaceShine app
✓ Fixed all build errors
✓ Pushed everything to GitHub
✓ Code is at: https://github.com/haywoodlatrice4-bot/haywood

EVERYTHING IS READY!

========================================
  WHAT YOU MUST DO (ONLY 3 CLICKS)
========================================

The site doesn't exist because you haven't 
IMPORTED your GitHub repo to Vercel yet.

This is the ONLY step that creates the deployment
and makes the 404 go away.

STEP 1: Open this link
https://vercel.com/new

STEP 2: Click "Import Git Repository"

STEP 3: Find "haywoodlatrice4-bot/haywood" 
        Click "Import"
        Click "Deploy"

THAT'S IT!

After you do this, the 404 will disappear and 
your site will exist at:
https://threespacshine.vercel.app

========================================
  WHY I CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU
========================================

I cannot click buttons on websites for you.
I can only:
- Write code ✓ DONE
- Push to GitHub ✓ DONE
- Fix errors ✓ DONE

You must:
- Import repo to Vercel (3 clicks)

========================================
  STOP TRYING TO VISIT THE SITE
========================================

The site doesn't exist yet!
You need to CREATE IT FIRST by importing 
your GitHub repo.

After you import it, THEN you can visit it.

========================================
  DO THIS NOW
========================================

1. Open: https://vercel.com/new
2. Import: haywoodlatrice4-bot/haywood
3. Deploy

The 404 will go away immediately after deployment.
