  HOW TO GET YOUR DATABASE URL
========================================

You are right - you need a database for logins and bookings to work.
Netlify does not give you one.

Here is the easiest way to get one for free:

OPTION 1: USE RAILWAY (Recommended)
----------------------------------------
Railway hosts your Backend AND Database together.

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" -> "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select "haywoodlatrice4-bot/haywood"
5. Click "Add a Database" -> Select PostgreSQL
6. Railway will automatically create the DATABASE_URL for you!

OPTION 2: USE NEON (Database Only)
----------------------------------------
1. Go to https://neon.tech
2. Sign up
3. Create Project "ThreeSpaceShine"
4. Copy the "Connection String"
5. That is your DATABASE_URL!

========================================
  WHERE TO PUT THE DATABASE_URL?
========================================

You need to put this URL in your BACKEND host settings (Railway or Render).

If using Railway for everything:
- You don't even need to copy it, Railway links it automatically.

If using Render for Backend + Neon for DB:
- Go to Render Dashboard -> Environment Variables
- Add DATABASE_URL = (paste Neon string)
