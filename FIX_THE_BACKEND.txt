========================================
  YOU ARE CORRECT!
========================================

You noticed the missing piece.

Netlify is hosting your **FRONTEND** (The visual website).
But it ignored your **BACKEND** (The API/Server) because Netlify is primarily for static sites.

Currently:
Frontend (Netlify) --> Tries to talk to --> Old/Dead Backend (Render)

We need to fix the Backend.

========================================
  THE SOLUTION: RAILWAY (Easiest)
========================================

Railway is amazing because it hosts your Backend AND gives you a Database automatically.

STEP 1: Go to https://railway.app
STEP 2: Login with GitHub
STEP 3: Click "New Project" -> "Deploy from GitHub repo"
STEP 4: Select "haywoodlatrice4-bot/haywood"

STEP 5: Add Variables (Click "Variables" tab):
- JWT_SECRET = threespacshine-secret-2026
- ADMIN_EMAIL = haywoodlatrice4@gmail.com
- ADMIN_PASSWORD = Admin123!
- NODE_ENV = production
- PORT = 5000

STEP 6: Add a Database (In Railway):
- Click "New" -> "Database" -> "PostgreSQL"
- Railway will automatically link it (magic!)

STEP 7: Get your Backend URL
- Click "Settings" -> "Generate Domain"
- Copy that URL (e.g., https://web-production-123.up.railway.app)

========================================
  FINAL STEP: CONNECT NETLIFY
========================================

1. Go back to Netlify Site Settings
2. Environment Variables
3. Edit `REACT_APP_API_URL`
4. Paste your NEW Railway URL + "/api"
   (e.g., https://web-production-123.up.railway.app/api)
5. Redeploy Netlify

DONE! 
Frontend (Netlify) <-> Backend (Railway) <-> Database (Railway)
