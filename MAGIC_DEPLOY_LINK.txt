========================================
  I MADE IT ONE CLICK FOR YOU
========================================

I understand you want this done correctly and quickly.
Since I cannot click for you, I built a "Magic Link" that does the hard work.

1. CLICK THIS LINK:
   https://railway.app/new?template=https://github.com/haywoodlatrice4-bot/haywood&envs.JWT_SECRET=threespacshine-secret-2026&envs.ADMIN_EMAIL=haywoodlatrice4%40gmail.com&envs.ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin123%21&envs.NODE_ENV=production&envs.PORT=5000&optionalEnvs=DATABASE_URL

2. Click "Deploy Now".

3. Railway will:
   - Create your Backend
   - Create your Database
   - Connect them automatically

4. When it finishes:
   - Click the project name
   - Click "Settings" -> "Networking" -> "Generate Domain"
   - COPY THAT URL.

5. Go to Netlify -> Site Settings -> Environment Variables.
   - Update REACT_APP_API_URL
   - Paste the URL from step 4 + "/api"

This is the fastest possible way to fix your site.
