========================================
  YOU FOUND THE MISSING PIECE!
========================================

You are absolutely right. The DATABASE_URL is missing because **Netlify DOES NOT provide a database.**

Netlify = Frontend Only (The pretty website).
Railway = Backend + Database (The brain and memory).

To fix this, you need to deploy your Backend to **Railway**.

========================================
  STEPS TO FIX (5 MINUTES)
========================================

1. Go to https://railway.app and login with GitHub.

2. Click "New Project" -> "Deploy from GitHub repo".
   Select: haywoodlatrice4-bot/haywood

3. Add these variables in Railway:
   - JWT_SECRET = threespacshine-secret-2026
   - ADMIN_EMAIL = haywoodlatrice4@gmail.com
   - ADMIN_PASSWORD = Admin123!
   - NODE_ENV = production
   - PORT = 5000

4. **CRITICAL STEP:**
   Click "New" -> "Database" -> "PostgreSQL".
   Railway will AUTOMATICALLY link this database to your backend.
   (This creates the DATABASE_URL for you!)

5. Get your Backend URL from Railway (Settings -> Networking).

6. Go back to Netlify -> Site Settings -> Environment Variables.
   Update REACT_APP_API_URL to be your new Railway URL + "/api".

========================================
  WHY DO THIS?
========================================

- Netlify makes your site fast.
- Railway handles your data and logins.
- Together, they make a complete professional app.
